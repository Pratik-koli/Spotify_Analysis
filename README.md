ðŸŽ§ Spotify Listening Data Analysis | Power BI Dashboard

This project analyzes Spotify listening patterns over multiple years, offering insights into user behavior, music trends, and platform engagement. Using Power BI, I transformed raw listening history into an interactive dashboard that highlights:

Albums, Artists & Tracks Trends â€“ Year-over-year comparisons with play counts, weekday vs. weekend listening habits, and top performers.

Listening Behavior Analysis â€“ Heatmaps showing hourly and daily activity patterns, revealing peak listening times.

Engagement Insights â€“ Comparison of listening time vs. track frequency to identify high-engagement songs.

Platform & Playback Analysis â€“ Filters for platforms, shuffle/skips, and yearly trends for granular insights.

By leveraging data modeling, DAX measures, and interactive visuals, this dashboard enables deep dives into music preferences, helping uncover patterns like top artists (The Beatles), high-play tracks ("Ode to The Mets"), and engagement shifts over time.

Tools Used: Power BI, DAX, Data Transformation & Visualization.
